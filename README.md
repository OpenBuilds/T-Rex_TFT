![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/932642/anim_pD38ovuSHo.gif)

This code was made on [ESP-WROVER-KIT](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/get-started-wrover-kit.html) and using [WROVER-KIT-LCD](https://github.com/espressif/WROVER_KIT_LCD) library.
The DinoGame folder needs to be in Arduino's libraries folder.
Aditional information about the project is [here](https://www.hackster.io/brzi/google-chrome-dinosaur-game-on-3-4-tft-c8ad88).
